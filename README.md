Coding project for storing weight and calories, viewing progress and calorie intake status(deficit, surplus).
First own project. I want this to be a useful tool and a way to dive deeper into programming.
Main goals:
- learn how to create a full stack project from the start
- create something actually useful, I want the tracker to be a multi-motivator(coding, learning, time management, as well as training and maintaing a deficit)
Wish me luck.
